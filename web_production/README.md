# Ada CoreNLP
A suite of NLP tasks built using deep learning and state-of-the-art neural networks. This technology will form the basis of the elements needed to create our semantic graph.

## Details
    - Dependency Parsing is currently using Stanford CoreNLP (no other part is). This hopefully will be deprecated in the near future.
    - All other models were trained using Wall Street + Brown data sets. Development is solely in NumPy and Autograd.
    - Lemmatization is currently using WordNet Morphy
    - CoRef is <b>coming soon</b>
